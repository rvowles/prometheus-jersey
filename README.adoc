= Prometheus Jersey Support

This is a fairly obvious, and yet simple library that lets you register a filter that will
histogram track your resource methods by adding an annotation rather than typing in code.

Simply add:

----
@Prometheus(name="metric_name", help="your help")
----

To your actual method (not the interface if you are separating api from implementation for using
client proxies). It tries to be efficient by keeping track of ignored methods as well.

To then use it in your Jersey application, add in:

----
register(PrometheusFilter.class);
----

It is, of course, released in Apache Maven Central, so just add the dependency to your pom:

----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.bluetrainsoftware</groupId>
	<artifactId>prometheus-jersey</artifactId>
  <version>1.1</version>
</dependency>
----

NB: always check the latest pom.xml in this repository, it will be one back (1.2-SNAPSHOT means current version is 1.1)
